# Screencast: Avoiding Content-specific Context

[原文](https://smacss.com/book/screencast-2)

Once again, [a request from Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrrocks/status/251222393597616128) creates an opportunity to review a design.

In this installment, Fran Pérez sends me an example mockup with some selected naming convention. I review the naming convention and suggest alternatives that should lead to a more flexible system.

Naming things is hard and I hope this screencast highlights ways in which a better naming convention makes things easier in the end—even if coming up with the names is hard.
