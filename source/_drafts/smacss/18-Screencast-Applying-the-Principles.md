# Screencast: Applying the Principles

[原文](https://smacss.com/book/screencast-1)

Donovan Hernandez had [tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/herrrnandez/status/147416331388583937) of his problems in applying SMACSS to his project. He was getting frustrated and felt that SMACSS was limiting his ability to get things done.

Donovan was nice enough to let me use his code as an example of how I would apply the principles of SMACSS on his project. (You'll have to excuse my dorky pronounciation of Donovan’s last name.)

The screencast touches on the following points:

* applying a naming convention that clarifies its purpose
* ensuring the CSS only affects the elements it’s supposed to
* reducing the depth of applicability



*Applying the Principles*
