Outlining how this should work.

* tag – a, button
* class – btn
* Possible displays:

1. single image sliding doors (horizontal only),
2. single image sliding doors (vertical and horizontal),
3. no images buttons (perhaps bowman/goog as inspiration) or some of the gradient transforms/filters

* Keep markup low (as few nodes as possible)
* Image, colors applied by a skin class, layout class for abstraction
* Inline-block
* Should be possible to float the buttons without breaking
